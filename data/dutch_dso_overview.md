## Grid Connection Process for Truck Parking Facilities

### General Requirements

1. **Connection Classification:**
   - Small-scale (kleinverbruik): Up to 3x80 ampere
   - Large-scale (grootverbruik): Above 3x80 ampere
   - Most truck parking with charging infrastructure requires large-scale connections

2. **Application Process:**
   - Applications submitted via national portal: **www.mijnaansluiting.nl**
   - For large-scale: Direct contact with DSO business departments
   - Lead times vary significantly due to grid congestion

3. **Grid Congestion:**
   - Significant capacity constraints across all three major DSOs
   - Priority frameworks may apply for social functions
   - Flexibility contracts being introduced to optimize capacity

### Truck Charging Infrastructure Considerations

**EU Requirements (by 2030):**
- Charging station for heavy goods vehicles every 60-100 km along motorways
- Target: 40,000 lower-power (100 kW) public overnight chargers at truck parking areas

**Current Development:**
- Milence operates 400 kW charging hubs in Netherlands
- LEAP24 developing charging infrastructure for commercial vehicles
- Grid operators developing sample layouts for rest area charging infrastructure

## Regulatory Oversight

**National Regulator:**
- **Autoriteit Consument & Markt (ACM)** - Dutch Authority for Consumers and Markets
- Website: www.acm.nl

**Transmission System Operator:**
- **TenneT TSO B.V.** - High voltage transmission network (110 kV and above)
- DSOs connect to TenneT's transmission network

---

## Key Considerations for Motorway Facilities

1. **Service Territory Identification:**
   - Determine DSO based on province and municipality
   - Border locations may require clarification

2. **Capacity Assessment:**
   - Check grid capacity maps (published by DSOs)
   - Anticipate potential waiting times in congested areas

3. **Connection Requirements:**
   - Heavy truck charging: Typically 150-400 kW per charging point
   - Multiple charging points require substantial grid capacity
   - May need dedicated transformer station

4. **Coordination:**
   - Early engagement with DSO (12-24 months advance recommended)
   - Coordinate with Rijkswaterstaat (motorway authority)
   - Consider backup power and load management systems
