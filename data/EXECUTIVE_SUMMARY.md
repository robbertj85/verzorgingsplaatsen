# Executive Summary: Electrical Grid Infrastructure for Dutch Motorway Truck Parking Facilities

## Project Overview

This analysis identifies electrical grid connection infrastructure and utility company responsibilities for truck parking facilities (verzorgingsplaatsen) along major Dutch motorways. The focus is on understanding which Distribution System Operators (DSOs) serve each location and what grid infrastructure is available to support current and future truck charging requirements.

### 2. Major Motorways and Their Responsible DSOs

| Motorway | Primary Route | Primary DSO | Transition Points |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **A1** | Amsterdam - German border | Liander → Enexis | Transition near Deventer |
| **A2** | Amsterdam - Belgian border | Stedin → Enexis | Transition near Den Bosch |

### 3. Grid Connection Requirements for Truck Charging

**Power Requirements:**
- Light truck charging: 50-150 kW per vehicle
- Heavy truck charging: 150-400 kW per vehicle
- Future megawatt charging: 1000+ kW

**Connection Classification:**
- Small-scale (kleinverbruik): Up to 3×80 ampere
- Large-scale (grootverbruik): Above 3×80 ampere
- **Most truck charging facilities require large-scale connections**

**Lead Times:**
- Standard large-scale connection: 6-18 months
- Congested areas: 18-36 months or longer
- **Recommendation: Initiate contact 12-24 months in advance**

### 4. Critical Grid Congestion Issues

**High Congestion Areas:**
- Liander: Gelderland, Noord-Holland, Zuid-Holland, Flevoland, Friesland
- Enexis: Noord-Brabant, Limburg
- Stedin: Randstad area (Rotterdam-Utrecht-Amsterdam)

**Impact:**
- Extended waiting times for new connections
- May require infrastructure upgrades at customer expense
- Priority frameworks available for social functions
- Flexibility contracts being introduced

### 5. EU Requirements Driving Infrastructure Development

**By 2030, EU regulations mandate:**
- Charging stations for heavy goods vehicles every 60-100 km along motorways
- 40,000 lower-power (100 kW) public overnight chargers at truck parking areas
- Netherlands must comply with Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR)

**Current Initiatives:**
- Milence: Operating 400 kW charging hubs
- LEAP24: Developing commercial vehicle charging infrastructure
- SPULA: Subsidy scheme for public charging infrastructure for heavy transport

## Grid Connection Process

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Identify Responsible DSO**
   - Use location (province/municipality) to determine DSO
   - Consult motorway_dso_mapping.csv for reference

2. **Assess Power Requirements**
   - Calculate total power needed (number of charging points × power per point)
   - Include facility services (lighting, amenities)
   - Plan for future expansion

3. **Check Grid Capacity**
   - Review DSO capacity maps
   - Identify congestion areas
   - Understand potential delays

4. **Initiate Contact with DSO**
   - **Liander:** 088 542 63 62 or via grootzakelijk portal
   - **Enexis:** 088 857 22 22 or via zakelijk contact
   - **Stedin:** Via www.mijnaansluiting.nl or zakelijk portal

5. **Submit Connection Request**
   - Provide site details, power requirements, timeline
   - Request feasibility study
   - Discuss capacity constraints and solutions

6. **Technical Design & Agreement**
   - DSO prepares connection design
   - Cost quotation provided
   - Connection agreement signed

7. **Construction & Commissioning**
   - Physical installation (may require transformer station)
   - Testing and activation
   - Metering arrangement (customer responsibility for large-scale)

---

## Financial Considerations

### Connection Costs:
- Distance to nearest connection point
- Required voltage level and transformer capacity
- New infrastructure requirements (cables, substations)
- Grid reinforcement in congested areas
- **Range: €10,000 - €500,000+ depending on complexity**

### Ongoing Costs:
- Annual grid capacity fees (transport tarieven)
- Electricity consumption (energy costs)
- Metering services
- Maintenance

### Available Support:
- **SPULA Subsidy:** Financial assistance for public charging infrastructure for heavy vehicles
- Various provincial and national grants for sustainable transport
- EU funding for AFIR compliance projects

## Technical Optimization Options

To address grid capacity constraints and optimize costs:

1. **Load Management Systems**
   - Dynamic load balancing across charging points
   - Prevent simultaneous peak demand

2. **Battery Energy Storage**
   - Peak shaving to reduce demand charges
   - Backup power during outages
   - Grid services revenue potential

3. **Flexibility Contracts**
   - Agreements with DSO to curtail load during peak times
   - Can accelerate connection in congested areas
   - May provide additional revenue

4. **Phased Deployment**
   - Start with lower capacity, expand over time
   - Match infrastructure growth to demand
   - Spread capital costs

5. **Smart Charging**
   - Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities
   - Time-of-use optimization
   - Integration with renewable energy

- Oversees DSO tariffs and service quality
- Website: www.acm.nl

**TenneT TSO B.V.**
- High voltage transmission operator (110 kV+)
- DSOs connect to TenneT network
- Website: www.tennet.eu

**Rijkswaterstaat**
- National motorway authority
- Land use and construction permits required
- Website: www.rijkswaterstaat.nl

## Recommendations

### For Project Planning:

1. **Early Engagement** - Contact responsible DSO 12-24 months before needed connection date

2. **Location Selection** - Consider grid availability as factor in site selection; locations near existing substations preferred

3. **Capacity Planning** - Design for future growth; adding capacity later may be difficult in congested areas

4. **Alternative Technologies** - In highly congested areas, consider battery storage, load management, or flexibility contracts

5. **Regulatory Coordination** - Engage Rijkswaterstaat early for land use and permits

6. **Financial Analysis** - Investigate available subsidies (SPULA, etc.) and factor in multi-year grid connection lead times

### Priority Actions:

1. ✓ Identify specific facilities for development
2. ✓ Determine responsible DSO for each location
3. → Contact DSOs to discuss projects and capacity availability
4. → Request preliminary feasibility studies
5. → Develop detailed power requirement specifications
6. → Prepare business case including grid connection costs
7. → Apply for relevant subsidies and permits
